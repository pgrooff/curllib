curllib
=======

First test of using curllib with cinema 4d R15 windows and mac

What I have done on my Windows 7 PC:
- download sources from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
- copied standard cinema4d plugin directory
- removed all unnecessary files
- set mode to debug and win32
- linking is ok
- however because I run R15 the win32 lib is not recognized. I have to go to X64
